Barcelona description:

Barcelona is a city on the coast of northeastern Spain.
It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality of Spain. 
With a population of 1.6 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high.
Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. 
After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, 
Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, 
became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, 
only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, 
shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. 
Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. 
Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, 
which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: 
the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. 
The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. 
The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences 
and expositions and also many international sport tournaments.
Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,
as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[9] As a leading world city, 
Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status.
Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,
 an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.

Leipzig:

Leipzig is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. 
With a population of 605,407 inhabitants as of 2021 
(1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), 
it is Germany's eighth most populous city, as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin.
Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, 
the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle Airport.
Leipzig is located about 160 kilometres (100 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, 
which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River 
and two of its tributaries: the Pleiße and the Parthe. 
The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.
Leipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire.
The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, 
two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing.
After the Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East Germany, 
but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, 
mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. 
The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy 
(which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry), severe unemployment, and urban blight. 
Starting around 2000, however, the decline was first arrested and then reversed and, since then, 
Leipzig has seen significant changes with the restoration of major historical buildings, 
the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.
Leipzig today is an economic centre, is rated as the most livable city in Germany by the GfK marketing research institution, and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany according to the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI) and Berenberg Bank.[16][17] The city is one of two seats of the German National Library, as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe.[18][19] Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system.[20] Leipzig is currently listed as a "Sufficiency" level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[21] Germany's "Boomtown"[22] and was the 2019 European City of the Year.
Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern "dark alternative music" or darkwave genres. 
The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. 
Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre "Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy". 
The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. 
Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig and, during a stay in the city, 
Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem "Ode to Joy".

Budapest

They call Budapest the Paris of the East and we certainly think it lives up to its reputation. 
It has elegant boulevards. 
It has so much beautiful architecture.
But it has much more grit and edge thanks to its years under communist rule. 
Walking its streets you can quickly tell that Budapest is a dynamic and living city.

One thing that makes Budapest so dynamic is its mix of Western and Eastern Europe. 
The city is still transitioning, 
so more and more young Hungarians are breathing new and youthful life into this great city. 
It’s still a little rough around the edges but that just adds to its charm.

The banks of the Danube river are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site so you should spend some time visiting the Danube Promenade. 
It’s also a great place to see many of Budapest’s best sights.

Perched above the city, Castle Hill is a must-visit neighborhood of Budapest. 
Some of the buildings date back to 14th and 15th centuries. Set aside a day to discover its winding cobble stone streets. 
The area also contains many of Budapest’s top attractions like Trinity Square, Matthias Church (Mátyás templom), 
Fishermen’s Bastion (Halászbástya), and Buda Castle.

Philadelphia (colloquially known simply as Philly) is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States.
It is the sixth-most-populous city in the United States and the most populous city in the state of Pennsylvania, 
with a 2020 population of 1,603,797. It is also the second-most populous city in the Northeastern United States, 
behind New York City. Since 1854, the city has had the same geographic boundaries as Philadelphia County, 
the most-populous county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the eighth-largest U.S. metropolitan statistical area, 
with over 6 million residents as of 2017. Philadelphia is also the economic and cultural center of the greater Delaware Valley 
along the lower Delaware and Schuylkill rivers within the Northeast megalopolis. 
The Delaware Valley's 2019 estimated population of 7.21 million makes it the ninth-largest 
combined statistical area in the United States.
Philadelphia is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States. 
William Penn, an English Quaker, founded the city in 1682 to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony.
 Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for 
 the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 
 at the Second Continental Congress, and the Constitution at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. 
 Several other key events occurred in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War including the First Continental Congress, 
 the preservation of the Liberty Bell, the Battle of Germantown, 
 and the Siege of Fort Mifflin. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until being overtaken by New York City in 1790; 
 the city was also one of the nation's capitals during the revolution, serving as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C. 
 was under construction. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and a railroad hub.
The city grew due to an influx of European immigrants, most of whom initially came from Ireland and Germany — 
 the two largest reported ancestry groups in the city as of 2015. 
Later immigrant groups in the 20th century came from Italy 
(Italian being the third largest European ethnic ancestry currently reported in Philadelphia) 
and other Southern European and Eastern European countries.[12] In the early 20th century, 
Philadelphia became a prime destination for African Americans during the Great Migration after the Civil War. 
Puerto Ricans began moving to the city in large numbers in the period between World War I and II, 
and in even greater numbers in the post-war period. 
The city's population doubled from one million to two million people between 1890 and 1950.

The Philadelphia area's many universities and colleges make it a top study destination, 
as the city has evolved into an educational and economic hub. 
As of 2019, the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product 
(GMP) of $490 billion.[17] Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in Pennsylvania and is home to five Fortune 1000 companies. 
The Philadelphia skyline is expanding, with a market of almost 81,900 commercial properties in 2016,
 including several nationally prominent skyscrapers.
  Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city.[20][21] Fairmount Park, 
  when combined with the adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the United States.
   The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial history, 
   attracting 42 million domestic tourists in 2016 who spent $6.8 billion, generating an estimated
    $11 billion in total economic impact in the city and surrounding four counties of Pennsylvania.
     Philadelphia is also a biotechnology hub.

Philadelphia is the home of many U.S. firsts, 
including the nation's first library (1731), hospital (1751), medical school (1765),
 national capital (1774), university (by some accounts) (1779), stock exchange (1790), zoo (1874),
  and business school (1881). Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks and the World Heritage 
  Site of Independence Hall. The city became a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities in 2015,
   as the first World Heritage City in the United States.


Aarhus

Aarhus is a university town located in Jutland, Denmark’s western province. 
It’s a small town and there’s not a lot to “do” here that would keep you here for days and days like in Copenhagen.
However, I found that to be the strength of the town.
It’s quiet. There are a lot of parks to wander through (the one near the university is especially peaceful). 
There’s a lively music scene and a lot of cheap food thanks to a thriving community of poor university students that make up most of the population.
In short, Aarhus is a calming contrast to busy Copenhagen and it’s worth spending 2-3 nights here.

Aarhus (officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 1 January 2011) is the second-largest city in Denmark 
and the seat of Aarhus municipality. 
It is located on the eastern shore of Jutland in the Kattegat sea and approximately 
187 kilometres (116 mi) northwest of Copenhagen.

The largest city in Jutland, 
Aarhus anchors the Central Denmark Region and the statistical region Landsdel Østjylland (LØ). 
The LØ is the second most populous statistical region in Denmark with an estimated population of 903,974 
(as of 1 January 2021). Aarhus Municipality defines the greater Aarhus area as itself and 
8 adjacent municipalities totalling 952,824 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2021) 
which is roughly analogous to the municipal and commercial collaboration Business Region Aarhus.
The city proper, with an estimated population of 282,910 inhabitants (as of 2021), ranks as the 2nd-largest city in Denmark.

Aarhus dates back to at least the late 8th century and is among the oldest cities in Denmark. 
It was founded as a harbour settlement at the mouth of the Aarhus River and quickly became a trade hub.
The first Christian church was built here around the year 900 and later in the Viking Age the town was 
fortified with defensive ramparts. The Viking Age was turbulent and violent, also for Aros, 
as the town was called back then, but in spite of the difficulties, the bishopric of Aarhus grew steadily stronger 
and more prosperous, building several religious institutions in the town during the early Middle Ages. 
Trade continued to improve, although it was not until 1441 that Aarhus was granted Market town privileges, 
and the population of Aarhus remained relatively stable until the 19th century. 
The 1600s, in particular, was a difficult time for Aarhus as the town suffered from several wars and the plague, 
and trade was also dampened by the state in favour of the royal seat of Copenhagen.
 Nevertheless, Aarhus grew to become the second biggest town in Denmark during that time,
and in the middle of the 1700s, the once prosperous trade growth returned. 
The industrial revolution became an inflection point in the 19th century, 
as industry drove a rapid population growth, outpacing regional rivals, 
and the first railway line in Jutland was built here in 1862. 
In 1928, the first university in Jutland was founded in Aarhus and today it is a university city 
and the largest centre for trade, services, industry, and tourism in Jutland.


Mieres

Mieres is a municipality of Asturias, northern Spain, 
with approximately 38,000 inhabitants. The municipality of Mieres is made up of the capital,

The topography of Mieres is mountainous with the greatest population centers being located in the 
valley along the banks of the Caudal River (Río Caudal) valley in the center of Asturias.
Before the Spanish Industrial Restructuring Mieres was one of the industrial backbones of Asturias, 
and hosted 70000 inhabitants in the 1960s. Today Mieres shelters a campus of the University of Oviedo and 
different museums in relation with the industrial heritage.

The municipality of Mieres is served by bus routes and the regional rail lines FEVE and RENFE Cercanias,
connected with Oviedo, Gijón, León and Langreo.
Mieres’ most popular and important festival St. John's Bonfire (La Foguera de San Juan) occurs every June 24's eve,
and is highlighted by a huge bonfire, cultural events, dancing, outdoor concerts, fireworks, al fresco dining and drinking.
Another important festival is the Folixa na Primavera in April (Spring Fiesta), which includes dance and music performances
from the nine European Celtic regions, food, drink and especially cider, (sidra).
