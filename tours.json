More than twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the capital projects itself as a young, dynamic and cosmopolitan city at the heart of Europe which is constantly re-inventing itself. Variety is guaranteed, but you can also travel to the German capital for rest and relaxation. In Berlin a fast paced metropolis and relaxing rest areas in nature are not far apart. Whether in Tiergarten, Tempelhofer Freiheit, Görlitzer Park or Grunewald – every district has its “green oasis”, which improves the quality of living and allows visitors to take a short break.\r\n \r\nCity of unlimited possibilities\r\n \r\nOriginally a symbol of separation, since Reunification the former “Walled City“ of Berlin, lying as it does at the interface between Western and Eastern Europe, has developed into a popular travel destination and is highly indicative of the current trend, not only as tourists from Germany are concerned but also visitors from abroad. Guests are not only interested in the history and culture of the city, but also in the lifestyle of its inhabitants.\r\n \r\nBut exactly what is it that actually makes Berlin so attractive? It is the diversity, the contrasts and the sheer inexhaustible potential of this capital city to consistently fire the enthusiasm of its visitors from all over the world. People are excited by the mixture of history and Zeitgeist, the broad spectrum of art, culture, music, entertainment and shopping facilities. The modern hotel landscape, the diversity of its cuisine and its outstanding cost-effectiveness by comparison to other destinations in Europe also go to make up the special charm that is the metropolis on the Spree. A flourishing creative scene together with Berlin’s hip music and club culture likewise contribute to the unmistakable lifestyle metropolis with a population of around 3.5 million.",

    "description": "Leipzig is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. \nWith a population of 605,407 inhabitants as of 2021 \n(1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), \nit is Germany's eighth most populous city, as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin.\nTogether with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, \nthe city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (100 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, \nwhich constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River \nand two of its tributaries: the Pleiße and the Parthe. \nThe name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire.\nThe city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, \ntwo important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing.\nAfter the Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East Germany, \nbut its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, \nmainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. \nThe immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy \n(which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry), severe unemployment, and urban blight. \nStarting around 2000, however, the decline was first arrested and then reversed and, since then, \nLeipzig has seen significant changes with the restoration of major historical buildings, \nthe demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.\nLeipzig today is an economic centre, is rated as the most livable city in Germany by the GfK marketing research institution, and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany according to the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWI) and Berenberg Bank.[16][17] The city is one of two seats of the German National Library, as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe.[18][19] Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system.[20] Leipzig is currently listed as a \"Sufficiency\" level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[21] Germany's \"Boomtown\"[22] and was the 2019 European City of the Year.\nLeipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. \nThe Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. \nLeipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". \nThe Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. \nJohann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig and, during a stay in the city, \nFriedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\".",

    "description": "Philadelphia (colloquially known simply as Philly) is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States.\nIt is the sixth-most-populous city in the United States and the most populous city in the state of Pennsylvania, \nwith a 2020 population of 1,603,797. It is also the second-most populous city in the Northeastern United States, \nbehind New York City. Since 1854, the city has had the same geographic boundaries as Philadelphia County, \nthe most-populous county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the eighth-largest U.S. metropolitan statistical area, \nwith over 6 million residents as of 2017. Philadelphia is also the economic and cultural center of the greater Delaware Valley \nalong the lower Delaware and Schuylkill rivers within the Northeast megalopolis. \nThe Delaware Valley's 2019 estimated population of 7.21 million makes it the ninth-largest \ncombined statistical area in the United States.\nPhiladelphia is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States. \nWilliam Penn, an English Quaker, founded the city in 1682 to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony.\n Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for \n the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 \n at the Second Continental Congress, and the Constitution at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. \n Several other key events occurred in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War including the First Continental Congress, \n the preservation of the Liberty Bell, the Battle of Germantown, \n and the Siege of Fort Mifflin. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until being overtaken by New York City in 1790; \n the city was also one of the nation's capitals during the revolution, serving as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C. \n was under construction. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and a railroad hub.\nThe city grew due to an influx of European immigrants, most of whom initially came from Ireland and Germany — \n the two largest reported ancestry groups in the city as of 2015. \nLater immigrant groups in the 20th century came from Italy \n(Italian being the third largest European ethnic ancestry currently reported in Philadelphia) \nand other Southern European and Eastern European countries.[12] In the early 20th century, \nPhiladelphia became a prime destination for African Americans during the Great Migration after the Civil War. \nPuerto Ricans began moving to the city in large numbers in the period between World War I and II, \nand in even greater numbers in the post-war period. \nThe city's population doubled from one million to two million people between 1890 and 1950.\n\nThe Philadelphia area's many universities and colleges make it a top study destination, \nas the city has evolved into an educational and economic hub. \nAs of 2019, the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product \n(GMP) of $490 billion.[17] Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in Pennsylvania and is home to five Fortune 1000 companies. \nThe Philadelphia skyline is expanding, with a market of almost 81,900 commercial properties in 2016,\n including several nationally prominent skyscrapers.\n  Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city.[20][21] Fairmount Park, \n  when combined with the adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the United States.\n   The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial history, \n   attracting 42 million domestic tourists in 2016 who spent $6.8 billion, generating an estimated\n    $11 billion in total economic impact in the city and surrounding four counties of Pennsylvania.\n     Philadelphia is also a biotechnology hub.\n\nPhiladelphia is the home of many U.S. firsts, \nincluding the nation's first library (1731), hospital (1751), medical school (1765),\n national capital (1774), university (by some accounts) (1779), stock exchange (1790), zoo (1874),\n  and business school (1881). Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks and the World Heritage \n  Site of Independence Hall. The city became a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities in 2015,\n   as the first World Heritage City in the United States.",

    "name": "Aarhus",
    "description": "Aarhus is a university town located in Jutland, Denmark’s western province. \nIt’s a small town and there’s not a lot to “do” here that would keep you here for days and days like in Copenhagen.\nHowever, I found that to be the strength of the town.\nIt’s quiet. There are a lot of parks to wander through (the one near the university is especially peaceful). \nThere’s a lively music scene and a lot of cheap food thanks to a thriving community of poor university students that make up most of the population.\nIn short, Aarhus is a calming contrast to busy Copenhagen and it’s worth spending 2-3 nights here.\n\nAarhus (officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 1 January 2011) is the second-largest city in Denmark \nand the seat of Aarhus municipality. \nIt is located on the eastern shore of Jutland in the Kattegat sea and approximately \n187 kilometres (116 mi) northwest of Copenhagen.\n\nThe largest city in Jutland, \nAarhus anchors the Central Denmark Region and the statistical region Landsdel Østjylland (LØ). \nThe LØ is the second most populous statistical region in Denmark with an estimated population of 903,974 \n(as of 1 January 2021). Aarhus Municipality defines the greater Aarhus area as itself and \n8 adjacent municipalities totalling 952,824 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2021) \nwhich is roughly analogous to the municipal and commercial collaboration Business Region Aarhus.\nThe city proper, with an estimated population of 282,910 inhabitants (as of 2021), ranks as the 2nd-largest city in Denmark.\n\nAarhus dates back to at least the late 8th century and is among the oldest cities in Denmark. \nIt was founded as a harbour settlement at the mouth of the Aarhus River and quickly became a trade hub.\nThe first Christian church was built here around the year 900 and later in the Viking Age the town was \nfortified with defensive ramparts. The Viking Age was turbulent and violent, also for Aros, \nas the town was called back then, but in spite of the difficulties, the bishopric of Aarhus grew steadily stronger \nand more prosperous, building several religious institutions in the town during the early Middle Ages. \nTrade continued to improve, although it was not until 1441 that Aarhus was granted Market town privileges, \nand the population of Aarhus remained relatively stable until the 19th century. \nThe 1600s, in particular, was a difficult time for Aarhus as the town suffered from several wars and the plague, \nand trade was also dampened by the state in favour of the royal seat of Copenhagen.\n Nevertheless, Aarhus grew to become the second biggest town in Denmark during that time,\nand in the middle of the 1700s, the once prosperous trade growth returned. \nThe industrial revolution became an inflection point in the 19th century, \nas industry drove a rapid population growth, outpacing regional rivals, \nand the first railway line in Jutland was built here in 1862. \nIn 1928, the first university in Jutland was founded in Aarhus and today it is a university city \nand the largest centre for trade, services, industry, and tourism in Jutland.",

Set aside a day to discover its winding cobble stone streets. \r\nThe area also contains many of Budapest’s top attractions like Trinity Square, Matthias Church (Mátyás templom), \r\nFishermen’s Bastion (Halászbástya), and Buda Castle.",
